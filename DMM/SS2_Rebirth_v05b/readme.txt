													REBIRTH 05a

The 05a version includes a Rebirth model of the thrown hybrid grenade. All the FM compatibility fixes are now in one DML file.

													REBIRTH 05

The 05 version includes fixed up models of the pipe hybrid and Diego, and also all four multiplayer player models (modifications done by RocketMan). The pipe hybrid's ankles now don't twist in unnatural ways after death, and Diego has a proper (round) bald head. A few FM compatibility fixes have been added as well.

													REBIRTH 04

The 04 version includes fixed up models of the pipe hybrid, shotgun hybrid, and midwife (modifications done by RocketMan). They all now have proper joints - as result, their necks are no longer rigid (headtracking will work), and the midwife and shotgun hybrid now launch their projectiles properly with their right arm (and not the abdomen). A few small model flaws have been fixed as well. Also, a previously unused corpse model with a ripped off arm is now used at a couple of places (corresponding ripped off arm model created by Olfred).

													REBIRTH 03a

The 03a version includes Olfred's hires gibs for the sake of convenience, and fixed (fingerprinted) dmls that will not conflict with FMs (the infamous "Ponterbee eng1 missing elevator switch" problem).

													REBIRTH 03

The 03 version adds hipoly gore - the ripped off arms, leg, head, and a Rebirth version of the suicide ghost. Also includes dmls that tweak the position of some corpses, so they fit into the environment properly. They also make sure the Rebirth models are loaded properly on the Earth map, no matter what version of the map is used. REBIRTH 03 should be compatible with any map mod out there (ADaoB, SCP, Secmod etc). As all mods that use dmls, it should be installed before one starts to play the game.


The model updates have been created by Olfred from the already available Rebirth models, the ghost texture has been made by Muzman, I wrote the dmls.

													REBIRTH 02 

This is an extended version of Cyberblutch's Rebirth Beta 01 Mod.
For further explanations on the original Mod see the description by Cyberblutch
(below the ASCII-art).

The extensions were either released by Cyberblutch himself (like the monkeys) or taken from a fanmission that he had contributed a model to (like the rumbler) or are modifications by other parties.

Following you will find some information about these additions:

1. Rebirth Monkeys
This is an unofficial beta release of the Rebirth Monkey, by
CyberBlutch. The beta release didn't include a texture for the
red monkey, so ZylonBane created one (and tweaked the blue
monkey texture to more closely resemble the original.

2. Rebirth Many Faces: Made by Blaydes
IIRC Blaydes' only change was to remove the strange red eyes from the Many's faces. 
Good idea.
 
3. The Oldschool Midwife
This is ZylonBane's Original SS2 Style Cyborg Midwife Skin. 
The Skin issued with the original Rebirth Mod release had many community members shake in ... well not in horror, as it was supposed to be. So ZylonBane recreated the original and much scarier SS2 skin for the new model by Cyberblutch.

4. The Rumbler
ZylonBane took this Model and Texture Update from Frobbers's Thief FM "Oracle of the Prophets" and released it unofficially at ttlg.com. See this thread: http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=78123

5. Rebirth models for living npcs 
Voodoo47 made the few living humans you meet (On earth, Chesapeake Bay, Chased woman, Watts, Cortez, ghosts) use the models by Cyberblutch with appropriate textures.

That's all.
Cheers, Kolya

		*******************************************

		*		System Shock Rebirth		*	
		*						*
		*		     - Beta 01 -			*
		*						*
		*******************************************


This is the beta 01 of the "Rebirth" mod made for the "System Shock 2" game made by Irrational and released in 1999.
In order to run it, an originale version of the game is required.
Even if it's not indispensable, i truly recommend to upgrade it with the patch available, before applying the "rebirth" mod.

If you want more info about this mod, go to the official web page:
	http://perso.wanadoo.fr/etienne.aubert/sshock/sshock_rebirth.html

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	1) INSTALLATION

- Unzip the compressed file you've just downloaded. It contains 2 files : this read, and a folder named "mesh".
- Simply copy and past the mesh folder in your main System Shock game directory.
	For example, if you've installed System Shock in c:/SShock2,
	Then just copy the "mesh" folder inside it... You will then have it at c:/SShock2/Mesh
- Lauch the game

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	2) UNINSTALLATION

The "Rebirth" mod doesn't modify anything else than AI Models and textures...
If you want to remove it completly, simply delete the "Mesh" folder...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	3) WHAT'S IN BETA 01?

Because it's a beta released, all AI models from "System Shock 2" haven't been upgraded yet... I planned to enhance them all, 
but it's a long task...
This beta version contains all the following models:
- Dead crew members of the Von Braun and the Rickenbacker.
- Ghosts
- Many Hybrid with Pipe
- Many Hybrid with Shotgun
- Many Hybrid with Grenades
- Midwife
- Cyborg Assassin

I've spend a lot of time to make this mod, and decided to release it to the public just to share the enjoyment that i'm still having 
by playing this fantastic game...
And of course, this "Rebirth" mod is totally free... :)

So... Enjoye !
