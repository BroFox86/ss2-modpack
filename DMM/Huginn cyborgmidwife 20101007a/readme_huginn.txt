[DESCRIPTION : non-nude high-res cyborg
midwife]

cyberblutch's cyborg midwife was
strangely ... attractive. For those who
prefer to be repulsed by those who are
trying to kill them, I've modified that
... one part of cyberblutch's high-res
skin to match the original midwife skin.

Get (almost) all the goodness of
cyberblutch's high-res midwife with none
of the awkwardness when strangers walk
by!

----------------------------------------
