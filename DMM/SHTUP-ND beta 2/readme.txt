System Shock 2 Texture Upgrade Project - NewDark (SHTUP-ND)
Beta 2.1 - Mar 23, 2024

About
=====
SHTUP-ND is a project to increase the quality of SS2's textures by recreating
them as faithfully as possible at a higher resolution. Most of the textures
that SS2 shipped with were only 128x128 or lower, even though SS2 supported
textures up to 256x256. The NewDark engine adds new texture features like
resolutions up to 4096x4096, animated material effects, environment maps,
and the ability to upgrade the resolution of terrain textures.

Additional objectives of SHTUP-ND include correcting typos and other graphical
glitches, enhancing animations, improving fonts, cleaning up the HUD overlays,
and basically doing whatever can be done to pretty up the graphics.

What Exactly Does it Do?
- Increases the resolution of most object textures
- Increases the polygon count of some objects
- Increases the resolution and frame rate of all animated screen textures,
  explosions, and water surfaces
- Increases the resolution of muzzle flashes and bullet holes
- Increases the resolution and detail of all skyboxes
- Improves the legibility of the small text fonts
- Cleans up interface icons and HUD graphics
- Corrects typos in some textures
- Adds new animations to some interface screens

SHTUP-ND is fully compatible with the System Shock 2 Community Patch (SCP) and
the Four Hundred (400) terrain texture mod.


Requirements and Installation
=============================
SHTUP-ND requires a retail copy of System Shock 2, patched to version 2.43
(NewDark) or higher. To ensure that you’re running the most current version,
use SS2Tool to make a new installation. SS2Tool is available here:
https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=4141.0

Hardware requirements are significantly higher than vanilla SS2 due to the
much greater load SHTUP-ND places on your video card RAM. You should have
at least a 1GB video card.

SHTUP-ND should be installed as a standard SS2 mod. For SS2 mod installation
instructions, see here:
https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=4790.0

Mod Priority: SHTUP-ND must be installed at a higher priority than SCP. Any
more specific object or texture mods should be installed at a higher priority
than SCP.

Do not install SHTUP-ND over the previous version of SHTUP or SHTUP-ND. Do
a clean install.

SHTUP-ND, like all purely graphical mods, may be activated or deactivated
mid-game.

This release incorporates Olfred's Fixed Objects v14, so there is no need to
install both.
