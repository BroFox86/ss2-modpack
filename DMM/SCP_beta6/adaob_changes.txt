** Weapons

*** Fusion Cannon

**** Energy damage is for robots

Analysis: 

The Fusion Cannon is badly unbalanced.  I'm not sure what to do with
this yet.  Energy weapons just aren't especially useful that late in the
game.  If it did a little Incendiary damage in addition to its Energy
burst, and was available earlier, it might be a lot better.  

Recommendation:

Suggest adding Stimulus/Incendiary 10 to Fusion Explosion and 15 to Big 
Fusion Explosion (but none for Droid Fusion Explosion, which is a seperate
object) and putting a broken Fusion Cannon (but in good condition once
repaired) and some Prisms in the Armory on Operations Deck.

++ Fusion Explosion (-1427)
   added Act/React: Sources: Incendiary, Intensity 10, Radius(10,LoS,none)
++ Big Fusion Explosion (-3854)
   added Act/React: Sources: Incendiary, Intensity 15, Radius(12,LoS,none)
++ Add Fusion Cannon and Prisms to Ops Deck Armory - see Operations

Result: 

I like the Fusion Cannon better now.  It might need a little more work,
but this is definitely better.  


**** Direct-Fire mode

Analysis:

I'm thinking of making the normal setting more of a direct-fire effect 
(faster shot, small area of effect) to give the Fusion Cannon a unique 
tactical advantage.  The only other weapon that has single target and 
wide area modes is the Stasis Field Generator, which is non-lethal.

Recommendation:

++ Fusion Shot (-232)
   Change Projectile: Initial Velocity: 60 -> 80
   Change Tweq: Rotate: x-rate-low-high: (20,0,360) -> (40,0,360)
   Change Tweq: Rotate: z-rate-low-high: (20,0,360) -> (30,0,360)
++ Fusion Explosion (-1427)
   Change Act/React: Sources: [all]: Shape: Radius: 10 -> 5
++ Big Fusion Shot (-3424)
   Add Projectile: Initial Velocity: 40
   Add Tweq: Rotate: 
     x-rate-low-high: (20,0,360)
     z-rate-low-high: (20,0,360) 

Result:

Direct-fire is good.  The setting descriptions are still applicable.
The "Death Mode" doesn't seem to do a whole lot more damage than normal
mode, though.  It is more, but it doesn't seem like enough more to 
justify the drastic difference in the projectile speed.  Of course, it
also has a much larger radius, but there aren't a whole lot of 
opportunities to take advantage of that fact.

This is done for now, but might want some more tuning later.


*** Laser Rapier

Analysis: 

The Laser Rapier is a little weak.  A slight increase in damage should
fix it.  It also needs to glow just a little.

Recommendation:

+- Electro Shock (-24)
   add Renderer: Dynamic Light: 150
   add Renderer: Light Color: hue 0.66, saturation 0.80
   add Act/React: Sources: Incendiary Stim,Contact(Low+Med), Intensity 2
   add Act/React: Sources: Incendiary Stim,Contact(High), Intensity 3


They're not glowing yet.  Adding Renderer properties to the individual
rapiers instead of just the archetype might help?

+- eng1.mis: Electro Shock (862)
+- hydro3.mis: Electro Shock (102)
+- ops4.mis: Electro Shock (354)
+- command2.mis: Electro Shock (2179)
   add Renderer: Dynamic Light: 150
   add Renderer: Light Color: hue 0.66, saturation 0.80

!- hydro2.mis: Electro Shock (1011)
   add Renderer: Dynamic Light: 150
   add Renderer: Light Color: hue 0.66, saturation 0.80
   deleted AmbientHacked: {3; 0; NoSharpCurve; es_loop}

Result:

They are doing some respectable damage now.  They're not the one-swing
wonder they were in System Shock 1, but that's okay.  And they glow.
The glow might even be a little too bright.  Well, except for the one in
hydro2.  That one isn't glowing.  Probably because the level is
stripped.  Yeah, I'm pretty much convinced that it's because the level is
stripped.  I haven't come up with any way to make that one glow yet.
Loading the level in the editor shows the right properties and switching
to game mode kinda looks like it's glowing (palette problems with my 
nVidia drivers) but loading the level normally, through the elevator, 
discards all those changes.


*** Pistol and Assault Rifle

Analysis:

The Assault Rifle and Pistol are a little too powerful.  A slight
decrease in base damage for both may be in order.

Recommendation:

!! Standard Bullet (-362)
   decrease Act/React: Sources: Standard Impact: Intensity from 4 to 3
!! AP Bullet (-492)
   decrease Act/React: Sources: Armor Piercing Impact: Intensity from 4 to 3
!! HE Bullet (-33)
   decrease Act/React: Sources: High Explosive: Intensity from 4 to 3
!! Assault Standard Bullet (-2253)
   decrease Act/React: Sources: Standard Impact: Intensity from 10 to 8
!! Assault AP Bullet (-2254)
   decrease Act/React: Sources: Armor Piercing Impact: Intensity from 10 to 8
!! Assault HE Bullet (-2252)
   decrease Act/React: Sources: High Explosive: Intensity from 10 to 8

Result:

This brings the assault rifle and pistol damage down into a reasonable
range, but makes the AP and HE bullets do that much less damage against
the wrong targets.  Lowering the standard bullet damage was not necessary, 
and made the pistol too weak for the early game.  That change was undone.

The assault rifle damage will be handled differently if its minimum
skill requirement is lowered from 6 to 3.  Those changes were undone.

May as well undo the pistol changes and switch to lowering
vulnerabilities instead of lowering base stimulus intensities.

*** AP and HE vulnerabilities

Analysis:

The first attempt at balancing the pistol and assault rifle didn't work 
out very well.  It might be better to leave the base stimulus intensities 
alone and lower the vulnerabilities of the targets from quadruple damage 
to triple.  The shotgun pellets should also spray 8 instead of 6 to make 
up for this change.

Recommendation:

++ Mechanical Vulnerability (-1052)
   Act/React: Receptron: Armor Piercing: Amplify: Multiply by 4 -> 3
++ Half Mechanical Vulnerability (-1329)
   Act/React: Receptron: Armor Piercing: Amplify: Multiply by 2 -> 1.5
++ Annelid Vulnerability (-1326)
   Act/React: Receptron: High Explosive: Amplify: Multiply by 2 -> 1.5
++ Human Vulnerability (-1230)
   Act/React: Receptron: High Explosive: Amplify: Multiply by 4 -> 3
++ Half Annelid Vulnerability (-1325)
   Act/React: Receptron: High Explosive: Amplify: Multiply by 4 -> 3
+- Pellet Projectile (-524)
   Gun: Projectile Description: Spray 6 -> 12, Spread 400 -> 150
+- Double Pellet (-3423)
   Gun: Projectile Description: Spray 6 -> 12, Spread 400 -> 150

Result:

These changes make the Pistol and Assault Rifle more reasonable.  The
Shotgun still needs some work.  Especially on those "pellets".

*** Bullets

Analysis:

I may have to add some more Bullets to Engineering, MedSci, and Hydroponics, 
to make up for reducing the amount of damage done by each bullet.
All areas of all three decks together have a total of:
  44+30+35+59+33+48+19 = 268 Standard Bullets
  24+0+24+12+12+12+6 = 90 Armor Piercing Bullets
  0+12+12+12+12+12+0 = 60 Anti-Personnel Bullets
Since damage per bullet has been multiplied by 3/4, but Pistols are not
particularly overpowered at the beginning of the game, the total number
of available bullets should be multiplied by 4/3, and the extra bullets
should be available earlier to offset the necessity of using them up
faster.  This means adding 89 Standard, 30 AP, and 20 HE Bullets.

Recommendation:

?? medsci1: add 20 Std, 9 AP
?? medsci2: add 16 Std, 7 AP, 6 HE
?? eng1: add 20 Std, 4 AP, 4 HE
?? eng2: add 11 Std, 7 AP, 6 HE
?? hydro1: add 10 Std, 3 AP , 4 HE
?? hydro2: add 12 Std

Result:

Standard bullets are not in short supply if their damage is not reduced.
I have not added any of the others, either.  It may not be necessary at
all.  Or maybe I should just add them in for Easy, and half of them for
Normal.

*** Shotgun and Assault Rifle skills

Analysis:

Instead of just lowering the damage of assault rifle bullets, I could lower 
both the skill requirements and the base damage of the shotgun and assault 
rifle so that they can be learned easily and optionally learned well.  This 
will also mean that when Marines train in Standard Weapons and "spend time
with pistols, assault rifles, and auto-shotguns", they'll actually get just
enough Standard skill to use an assault rifle, once they can find one.

There are shotguns on Deck 2, but no assault rifles until halfway through 
Deck 3, unless you manage to break into the Med/Sci Sub-Armory early.  Maybe
I'll add a broken assault rifle somewhere on Deck 2, and a working one in
Engineering.  

Of course, this makes pistols almost entirely obsolete.  Unless I can
find something interesting to do with pistols...

Original
	Skill		1	2	3	4	5	6
   Pistol :		4	4.6	5.2	5.8	6.4	7.0
   Shotgun : 
     standard				8	9.20	10.40	11.60	
     high explosive			6x1	6x1.15	6x1.30	6x1.45
   Assault Rifle : 						10

Tried this once, with quad-damage vulnerabilities...
	Skill		1	2	3	4	5	6
   Pistol :
     standard		4	4.6	5.2	5.8	6.4	7.0
     armor piercing	3	3.45	3.90	4.35	4.80	5.25
     high explosive	3	3.45	3.90	4.35	4.80	5.25
   Shotgun : 
     standard			7	8.05	9.10	10.15	11.20
     high explosive		6x1	6x1.15	6x1.30	6x1.45	6x1.60
   Assault Rifle : 
     standard				7	8.05	9.10	10.15
     armor piercing			6	6.9	7.8	8.7
     high explosive			6	6.9	7.8	8.7

With quad-damage vulnerabilities, minimum skill 3, and 6 or 7 base 
damage, the assault rifle STILL kicks ass, and plenty of it, especially 
at skill 6.  Maybe setting the base damage of all assault rifle bullets, 
at skill 3, to 6.25, AND lowering the vulnerabilities from 4 to 3 would 
balance it.

Proposed
 Skill             1        2        3        4        5        6
   Pistol :        4        4.6      5.2      5.8      6.4      7.0
   Shotgun :
     slug                   7        8.05     9.10     10.15    11.20
     pellet                 6x1      6x1.15   6x1.30   6x1.45   6x1.60
   Assault Rifle :                   6.25     7.18     8.12     9.06

Recommendation:

++ Shotgun (-19)
   Player: Weapon Skills: Conventional 3 -> 2
++ Hybrid Shotgun (-4073)
   Player: Weapon Skills: Conventional 3 -> 2
++ Assault Rifle (-18)
   Player: Weapon Skills: Conventional 6 -> 3
++ Rifled Slug (-516)
   Act/React: Sources: Standard Impact: Intensity 8 -> 7
++ Double Slug (-3422)
   Act/React: Sources: Standard Impact: Intensity 16 -> 14
++ Assault Standard Bullet (-2253)
   Act/React: Sources: Standard Impact: Intensity 10 -> 6.25
++ Assault AP Bullet (-2254)
   Act/React: Sources: Armor Piercing Impact: Intensity 10 -> 6.25
++ Assault HE Bullet (-2252)
   Act/React: Sources: High Explosive: Intensity 10 -> 6.25

Result:

I've tried this twice, and it works pretty well.  It's nice to be able to
use any standard weapon with just skill 3, but it's a bit misleading.
It makes the Assault Rifle seem weak and pointless to use it at skill 3,
when it's about the equivalent of a modified pistol.  Pistols are easier
to modify, and a fully modified pistol does more damage per bullet than
an unmodified Assault Rifle.  Once you get up to Standard 5 and modify
the Assault Rifle, it becomes noticably better than the Pistol, but not
quite as Uber as it used to be.  If you do max out Standard skill, as
you would have had to in the original game just to use it, it's still a
mighty weapon, effective against any enemy, worthy of spending all those
points on and skipping the other weapons, but it's not so overpowered
that Standard is the single optimal path.

I haven't played through with Standard weapons only yet, so I don't know
whether the decreased damage makes a significant difference in the
number of bullets that should be available.  Standard rounds in the
Pistol do the same damage they always did, and that's pretty much all
the projectiles you have in the first few levels.


*** Shotgun kickback

Analysis:

It has been suggested (by Mehrunes) that the shotgun's Kickback 
Return should be changed to 1.5 for setting 0 and 2.0 for setting 1 
"so that it recoils nicely like the assault rifle."

Recommendation:

++ Shotgun (-19)
   Change Gun: Kickback: Kickback Return (mode 0) from 1.0 to 1.5
   Change Gun: Kickback: Kickback Return (mode 1) from 1.0 to 2.0
++ Hybrid Shotgun (-4073)
   Change Gun: Kickback: Kickback Return (mode 0) from 1.0 to 1.5
   Change Gun: Kickback: Kickback Return (mode 1) from 1.0 to 2.0

Result:

I personally don't see the difference.


*** Conventional Weapon Repair

Analysis:

Repair is a seriously underpowered and underutilized skill, 
partially because it takes so many skill points just to perform 
the most basic tasks.  All you can do with Repair 1 is unjam a 
pistol or laser pistol and it takes Repair 3 to unjam a shotgun.
EMP Rifles only need Repair 2, but they break so easily that they
need it (except that half of them in the original game couldn't
break at all...)  With the relative value and scarcity of cyber 
modules compared to maintenance tools, not to mention whole 
replacement weapons, Repair just doesn't make logistical sense.

Part of my solution to this (albeit a small part) is to make 
Standard weapons easier to repair, reducing the requirements for 
shotgun and assault rifle from 3 and 4 to 2 and 3.

Recommendation:

++ Shotgun (-19)
   Change Player: Tech Skills: Repair 3 -> 2
++ Hybrid Shotgun (-4073)
   Change Player: Tech Skills: Repair 3 -> 2
++ Assault Rifle (-18)
   Change Player: Tech Skills: Repair 4 -> 3

Result:

I never bother to repair these anyway, but if I did, they'd be easier than
they were.


*** EMP Rifle

Analysis:

There should be more of a difference between the settings of the EMP Rifle.
Overload costs ten times as much energy, but does only slightly more damage.
It's already effective enough, on either setting, so I'm going to try to make
it more interesting.  For now, I'll settle for reactivating the Source Scale
Propagation, which raises the Overload damage from 150% to 450%.

One idea to make EMP Explosion more interesting:
!! EMP Explosion (-1424)
   Act/React: Sources: EMP: change dispersion from None to Inverse Quadratic
   add Act/React: Sources: ElectroDampen Intensity 10, Radius 20, Linear

I tried this.  I didn't like it.  I changed it back.  I'll work on this
some more later.  This particular version of the stun effect, while 
moderately interesting, is not especially useful.  Maybe if the EMP damage 
were increased enough to at least pop the Protocol droids, it would be more 
useful.  Intensity 10 should be more than enough for that, but it isn't.  
Apparently because of the Inverse Quadratic.  Without the Inverse Quadratic,
a "normal" shot is more than sufficient to take out cameras and protocol
droids.

Recommendation:

ElectroDamp Vulnerability (-3445)
+- add Receptron: EMP, Min 0, Max none, Freeze AI, Duration * 1
   add Receptron: EMP, Min 0, Max none, Add MetaProperty, 

Make EMP Grenade Projectiles use Big EMP Explosion instead of EMP Explosion
++ EMP Grenade Proj (-1349)
   change Corpse link from EMP Explosion (-1424) to Big EMP Explosion (-4858)
++ Bouncy EMP Grenade Proj (-3428)
   change Corpse link from EMP Explosion (-1424) to Big EMP Explosion (-4858)

++ EMP Explosion (-1424)
   Act/React: Sources: EMP: Intensity 10 -> 5
   add Act/React: Sources: EMP: Intensity 5, no Line of Sight (Raycast)
++ Big EMP Explosion (-4858)
   Act/React: Sources: EMP: Intensity 15 -> 7
   add Act/React: Sources: EMP: Intensity 7, no Line of Sight (Raycast)

With source-scale propagation and "Big EMP Explosion" grenades, an EMP 
Grenade from a fully-modified launcher or an EMP Rifle on overload is 
a one-shot kill for anything mechanical.  EMP Rifles only get 5-8 of 
those overloaded shots on a full charge, though, and EMP Grenades are 
fairly rare, so that might be okay, but I'd rather tone it down a bit.

By slightly lowering the intensity of a "Big EMP Explosion" (from 15 to
14), a single EMP Rifle overload shot will destroy anything mechanical, 
except an Assault Droid, and it takes a Sharpshooter upgrade or a 
modified EMP Rifle to destroy an Assault Droid with one hit.  

With no bonuses, it takes three EMP grenades to do the same thing, but
that's at Skill 1.  A single EMP Grenade from a fully-modified launcher 
at Heavy 1 will pop a Security Droid just as well as an EMP Rifle at 
Energy 6.  Heavy 3 or Heavy 2 and Sharpshooter will make the fully-
modified Grenade Launcher a one-shot EMP kill for even Assault Droids.

Clearing the LoS/Raycast flag allows you to destroy a camera by firing a 
Normal EMP shot at the other side of the wall it's mounted on, which is
pretty cool.  In Overload mode, you can also use this trick to detonate 
turrets and droids behind doors without opening them.  That's a little too 
useful.  I split the stim into two, one with raycast and one without, so 
that intervening walls at least reduce the damage (by half).

That worked okay when grenades could be powered up with skill and 
modification to make them as powerful as the EMP Rifle.  Now that the 
grenade damage is being changed to not scale at all, the grenades need to 
do more damage, without unbalancing the EMP Rifle.  I could make another 
explosion type for EMP grenades, or I could reduce the Stim Mult on the 
EMP Rifle's overload shot to reduce the difference between a grenade's 
Big EMP Explosion and a rifle's Big EMP Explosion.  Since I'm changing the 
EMP Rifle effects a lot anyway, I'll opt for the lower Stim Mult and 
increase the Big EMP Explosion damage to 10(raycast)+10(no raycast).

+- Big EMP Explosion (-4858)
   Act/React: Sources: EMP: Intensity 7 -> 10, with Line of Sight (Raycast)
   Act/React: Sources: EMP: Intensity 7 -> 10, no Line of Sight (Raycast)
   add Act/React: Sources: ElectroDampen: 
	Intensity 20, Radius 15, no LoS, Linear

+- EMP Explosion (-1424)
   add Act/React: Sources: ElectroDampen: 
	Intensity 10, Radius 10, no LoS, Linear

+- EMP Rifle (-23)
   Base Gun Description: Setting 1: Stim Mult 3.00 -> 2.00

+- EMP Grenade Proj (-1349)
   change Act/React: Sources: EMP: Intensity 3 -> 1
+- Bouncy EMP Grenade Proj (-3428)
   change Act/React: Sources: EMP: Intensity 3 -> 1

A direct hit from an EMP Rifle on Overload with that exlosion should do 
20 base * 2.0 mult * 4.0 vulnerability = 160 points of damage to robots,
and half that, 80 points of damage, to cyborgs.  That will kill any mech
except an Assault Droid.  Applying Modification 2 or SharpShooter and Mod1 
bring the total up to 200 points, which kills an Assault Droid.

A grenade with no multipliers would do 84-102 damage to robots and 42-54 
to cyborgs with that same explosion.  (The 1 point of projectile contact
damage gets full bonus multipliers.)  Thus one grenade would kill any 
turret or midwife, it would take two to kill an assassin, maintenance 
droid, or security droid, and three for an assault droid.  Pretty good 
for only 1 point of skill, but unless you spend a lot of nanites on EMP 
grenades, you'll run out of ammo much faster than you run out of robots.  
Of course, the standard, proximity, and disruption grenades are also 
effective against the big bots, and standard frag grenades with these 
changes do quite a lot of damage, so the grenade launcher is certainly a 
viable choice for blowing up robots.

Result:

Not tested yet.


*** Annelid Launcher

Analysis:

The Annelid Launcher is much too expensive for its limited usefulness.
Making it more sturdy, making more ammo available, and improving all of
its speed factors are my favorite options for this at the moment.

Recommendation:

++ Small Worm Beaker (-48)
   increased Engine Features: Stack Count from 4 to 6
++ Large Worm Beaker (-1264)
   increased Engine Features: Stack Count from 8 to 12
++ Worm Beakers (-47)
   decreased Obj: Recycle Value from 3 to 2
   decreased Psi: Fabricate Cost from 120 to 80
++ Worm Launcher (-27)
   decreased Gun: Reliability: Break Threshhold from 25 to 15
   decreased Gun: Reliability: Degrade Rate from 3.0 to 2.2
   increased Gun: Base Gun Description: Setting 0 Clip from 8 to 12
   increased Gun: Base Gun Description: Setting 1 Clip from 8 to 12
   
++ AH Annelid Rocket (-1356)
   Physics: Projectile: Initial Velocity: X 25 -> 40
   Gun: Homing Projectile: Distance Filter 50 -> 100
   Gun: Homing Projectile: Heading Filter 1350 -> 2700
   Gun: Homing Projectile: Max Turn 800 -> 1600, 
   Gun: Homing Projectile: Update Freq 200 -> 100
++ AA Annelid Rocket (-3502)
   Physics: Projectile: Initial Velocity: X 25 -> 40
   Gun: Homing Projectile: Distance Filter 50 -> 100
   Gun: Homing Projectile: Heading Filter 1350 -> 2700
   Gun: Homing Projectile: Max Turn 800 -> 1600, 
   Gun: Homing Projectile: Update Freq 200 -> 100

Result:

Definitely have plenty of worms now.  I had over 200 of them when I went
after the Brain.  And my Worm Launcher didn't break after firing two
whole clips.  The problem now is that there's just no point.  The new and 
improved Viral Proliferator also kills Psi Reavers with one shot, after a
few seconds, so why spend all those extra modules on the Worm Launcher?  
Maybe I should give the Launcher the same viral infection magic that the 
Proliferator has?

The projectile speed changes help, but I think what the Annelid Launcher
really needs is less kickback.  This thing blocks a third of your screen
and gets you dizzy every time you fire it, which can get you lost and/or
killed pretty quick in the Body of the Many, which is actually the only
place you can use it.  Or maybe I should spend more on Agility.

*** Viral Proliferator

Analysis:

The Viral Proliferator is pretty weak for something so hard to use.  I'm
not entirely sure what to do about it, though.  Making it easier to
modify and making more ammo available would help.  I don't want to make
it available earlier, because of all the logs on the Recreation desk
that refer to it.  Widening the burst radius and/or changing the burst
dispersion are also options.

Recommendation:

++ AH Viral Explosion (-1507)
   Act/React: Sources: Anti-Human: Radius 10 -> 15
++ AA Viral Explosion (-3559)
   Act/React: Sources: Anti-Annelid: Radius 10 -> 15

Viral Infection - slow poison effect

To make the Viral Proliferator actually useful, two new stimulus types can 
be introduced, with two new metaproperties that cause continuous damage to 
the target once applied.  This makes the Viral Proliferator a one-shot kill
on any organic or semi-organic target, but only if it's configured properly, 
and it's a slow, painful death.

With the infection effect, the burst itself doesn't need to do as much damage.

   Act/React: Sources: Anti-Annelid: Intensity 15 -> 10
++ Anti-Human Viral Explosion (-1507)
   Act/React: Sources: Anti-Human: Intensity 15 -> 10

The problem is that it's *way* too good against Psi Reavers.  It obliterates 
them on contact.  Apparently the burst damage (before I reduced it) in 
addition to the "viral infection" damage, both of which do quadruple damage
to pure annelids, were enough to kill a Psi Reaver instantly.  After reducing
the burst damage, it became obvious that the infection was working normally 
on the Psi Reavers, except for the fact that they were respawning with the
infection still active.  It's a lot easier to make them immune to the viral 
infection, (they are psionic projections, so they don't necessarily have to 
follow the rules) but I decided to do it the hard way and make the infection
expire when the projection vanishes.  This requires four new objects, an
individual name, and an individual receptron for each Psi Reaver.  Good 
thing there are so few of them in the game.

Result:

Wow.  Vast improvement.  There are a number of cases where you can hit a
Rumbler with this and then hide while it slowly dies.  It's great for
spiders and swarms, too.  It kills Psi Reavers in one hit and about ten
seconds, depending on how much damage you do with the initial burst.  That
makes it almost as good as the Annelid Launcher against Psi Reavers.

*** Laser Weapons

Analysis:

There's just no excuse for seeing a "laser beam" coming at you.  And you
shouldn't be able to see it from the side or rear unless it's being 
scattered by something it's passing though.  It's coherent light.  If you 
can see it, it just hit you.  Lasers need to be instant-hit weapons.  If 
they don't work as instant-hit weapons, they need to be called something
other than lasers.  And lasers should not illuminate anything they don't 
directly hit.  Lasers should also be visible when they pass through steam 
or smoke, but I don't think this engine can handle that.

Recommendation:

-- Laser Shot (-2474)
   Physics: Projectile: Initial Velocity: X 100 -> 500
   DELETE Renderer: Dynamic Light: 75
   DELETE Renderer: LightColor: Hue 0.66, Saturation 1.00
-- Big Laser Shot (-2255)
   Physics: Projectile: Initial Velocity: X 100 -> 500
   DELETE Renderer: Dynamic Light: 75
   DELETE Renderer: LightColor: Hue 0.00, Saturation 0.80
-- Midwife Shot (-1603)
   Physics: Projectile: Initial Velocity: X 50 -> 500
-- Droid Laser Bolt (-1501)
   Physics: Projectile: Initial Velocity: X 100 -> 500
-- Turret Laser Bolt (-1414)
   Physics: Projectile: Initial Velocity: X 200 -> 500
++ Rick Turret Shot (-4649)
   Physics: Projectile: Initial Velocity: X 200 -> 500

Result:

Too much of a divergence from the original.  No significant difference
in the effect of the Laser Pistol.  It just looks a little more
believable.  There is a very significant difference in the strengths of
the enemies, though.  The instant-hit lasers give them much better
accuracy, since strafing and dodging become irrelevant.  I'm going to
leave the Rick Turrets that way for now, but I think I'll try changing
the names and text of the other "laser" weapons to "plasma" so that
accuracy is less of an issue.

*** Argon-Suspension Laser Pistol

**** Argon lasers are not red

Analysis:

The low-power blue beam is close to one of the possible wavelengths an Argon 
laser can produce.  The color #0D00FF is a good approximation of 457.9nm, and 
the blue laser model is almost exactly that color.  Since I'm going to be 
either changing both settings to fire a projectile too fast to see at all, or 
changing the name of the weapon to "Plasma Pistol", it probably doesn't matter 
anyway.

Recommendation:

?? Big Laser Shot (-2255)
   Shape: Model Name: lazboltr -> lazbolt2
   Links: Miss Spang: Red Laser Spang (-4277) -> Laser Spang (-4276)
   Links: ~ParticleAttachemnt: Red Laser Trail (-2547) -> Blue Laser Trail (-2546)

Result:

None.  I haven't changed this yet, and I'm probably not going to.  I
think I like the "Plasma Pistol" solution better.

**** Plasma pistol

Analysis:

If the laser pistol is changed to a plasma pistol, the high power setting
should do some decent damage to flesh targets.  Hot plasma should do
Incendiary damage.  And both hot and cold plasma should do Electrical
damage, not this vague "energy", but this is a semantic issue.  The names
of the damage types are not visible to the player, only the effect is.
A plasma pistol set to fire blobs of hot plasma should be effective 
against enemies that are vulnerable to fire.  I'm just not sure how I feel 
about a weapon in the Energy category that does significant damage to 
Annelids.  That would make Energy a more well-rounded choice, instead of an
anti-mech specialty.  Standard and Heavy are the all-purpose weapons.
Energy and Annelid weapons are specialized.  Still, I'll give the plasma
pistol a couple points of Incendiary, just so it can pretend to be trying
to live up to the name.

Recommendation:

++ Big Laser Shot (-2255)
   Act/React: Sources: Energy Stim, Contact, Intensity 12 -> 10
   add Act/React: Sources: Incendiary, Contact, Intensity 2

(various changes to strings)

Result:

Still practically useless against Annelids - but it's supposed to be.

*** Damage Bonus Propagation

**** Grenade Launcher

Analysis:

Those grenades that do get damage bonuses get more than other weapons.
Grenade Launcher Modification 1 doubles grenade damage (200%), and level
2 is 228%. Other weapons are all 110% and 125%.  Grenades do 35% more
damage for Sharp Shooter instead of 15%.  These are anomalies, but I'm
not sure they need to be fixed.  The only way I can think of to fix them
would be to disable all damage bonuses for grenades.

Disruption Grenades don't get damage bonuses, but with full damage
bonuses, they would take out a Rumbler with one hit.  I'm planning to
give them the damage bonuses, but make fewer of them available on higher
Difficulty levels.  This is not caused by unchecked "Propagate Source
Scale" properties.  It's because the Stimulus comes from the Disruption
Burst (-1309) but the Green Core (-1522) is what gets the propagated
scale.

Also, having Radius only slightly smaller than normal with Linear
dispersion and much higher base intensity would fit the description 
better.

-- Moved stimulus from Disruption Burst (-1309) to Green Core (-1522)
   Act/React: Sources: Standard Impact
     Intensity 35 -> 75, Radius 10 -> 8, Dispersion None -> Linear

With all bonuses, 35 damage and Linear dispersion takes two good hits 
to kill a Rumbler.  Apparently, that Linear Dispersion is losing more 
than half the damage, even if the grenade actually impacts the Rumbler.
I like the idea of Disruption Grenades that are extremely powerful in a
very small area of effect. 75 damage should kill a rumbler with one 
direct hit (with all bonuses), but that would probably mean they could 
kill anything in the game with one hit.  If they're going to do that, 
there should definitely be fewer of them, on Hard and Impossible at least.

Of course, that's only if you double-modify the grenade launcher and
have maximum skill in Heavy weapons.  With only Heavy 1 and an 
unmodified launcher, grenades are useless.  That really doesn't make a 
whole lot of sense.  Maybe grenade damage should be fixed at about 5 times 
its current base. (2.28 for Mod2 * 1.75 for +5 skill * 1.35 for 
sharpshooter = 5.3865)  That would make grenades really kick ass early in 
the game, when there aren't many of them, but skill, modifications, 
"sharpshooter", and research would have no further effect on them.

Recommendation:

++ Moved stimulus from Disruption Burst (-1309) to Green Core (-1522)
   Act/React: Sources: Standard Impact
     Intensity 35 -> 350, Radius 10 -> 8, Dispersion None -> Linear

++ Disruption Grenade Projectile (-1350)
   Edit Link --corpse-> Green Core (-1522)
   - Data: Propagate Source Scale=NULL

++ Bouncy Disruption Grenade Proj (-3429)
   Edit Link --corpse-> Green Core (-1522)
   - Data: Propagate Source Scale=NULL

Result:

Disruption Grenades now kill anything with one hit, regardless of the 
launcher or the skill of the firer.  The only exception is Rumblers, which
can survive one hit if you only have skill 1 and an unmodified launcher 
and hit them right on the nose.  Apparently the dispersion from that beak
to the center of the creature is just enough for that.  If you hit them on
the side or the back, fire a second grenade, or use a modified launcher and
more skill, one hit kills them even straight on.  If the grenade doesn't 
actually HIT the rumbler, you'll probably have to launch another.

**** The Other Grenades

Analysis:

Grenade damage should not be dependent on the launcher, or the skill or the
user, or the weak points of the target.  The challenge is matching the 
availability of the grenades with the power of the different types and the
strength of the enemies, so that they remain relatively balanced without
scaling their damage throughout the game.

Standard grenades (frag and prox) should be enough to kill any hybrid or 
monkey, but only half enough to kill a turret or midwife.  That's 24-36
points of Standard Impact.  Less than 30, it takes three to kill an Assassin, 
at 30 or more, it takes two.  I'm setting it to 25.  That's 25% more than the
base, approximately the effect you'd get with Heavy 3.

Incendiary grenades are spider-slayers, and are effective against Rumblers.
Both take double damage.  Arachnids have 60HP, Rumblers 220.  Tripling the 
base damage from 15 to 45, Arachnids die with one shot, and Rumblers take
three.  Triple damage is equivalent to Sharpshooter + Heavy 6 + Mod 1 or 
Heavy 3 + Mod 2, neither of which is unreasonable by the time you find 
Rumblers.

EMP Grenades are a problem.  If they are equivalent to EMP Rifles on 
Overload, the EMP Rifle, requiring skill 6 to do what the Grenade Launcher 
would do with 1, becomes entirely obsolete, despite the limited number of EMP 
grenades available, unless of course, the grenades become even more limited.  
Making them equivalent to the EMP Rifle's normal setting might be too weak.  
I'll try the overload settings without the x3 multiplier the Rifle applies and
see how that works.

Results:

- Standard and Proximity Grenades kill hybrids, monkeys, and baby spiders.
  Midwives and Red Assassins take two, Black Assassins barely survive two
  Turrets take 2, Maintenance 4, Security 6 (+ 1 bullet), Assault 8
  Adult spiders take three hits, and Rumblers take 9!
- Incendiary kills any hybrids, monkeys, or spiders with 1 hit
  Cyborgs take about the same damage as they do from Fragmentation
  Rumblers take 3 hits
- EMP kills turrets and midwives instantly
  heavily damages assassins (second EMP or a few bullets to kill)
  stuns and damages any big bots, but it takes 2 or 3 grenades to kill them.
  (Of course, while they're stunned, you can just run up and wrench them.)

Standard = cheap, Incendiary = Spider Slayer, EMP = Bot Killer
and Disruption is perfect for Rumblers.

And all that only takes 1 point of skill, no modify, no research, no traits.
Balancing this is the scarcity/expense of the ammo, the time to reload and
refire the launcher, the fact that with five slots for ammo, it takes more
inventory than any other weapon, and the problem of blowing yourself up if
you miss or fire too close.  I think this is going to be a favorite for 
Impossible mode, but a Viral Proliferator and EMP Rifle combo is still
better if you can afford the modules.

**** Other

Analysis:

Fusion Cannon, EMP Rifle, and Viral Proliferator shots also do not get
damage bonuses.  These can be fixed without much worry about making them
too powerful, since Fusion Cannon and Viral Proliferator are currently
underpowered, and EMP Rifles would only get bonuses for Sharp-Shooter
and Modification anyway, not Research or Skill.

Recommendation:

++ Fusion Shot (-232)
   set Links:Corpse:Fusion Explosion (-1427) Data = TRUE
++ Big Fusion Shot (-3424)
   set Links:Corpse:Big Fusion Explosion (-3854) Data = TRUE

   set Links:Corpse:AH Viral Explosion (-1507) Data = TRUE
++ AA Viral Shot (-2695)
   set Links:Corpse:AA Viral Explosion (-3559) Data = TRUE

Result:

The EMP Rifle has a Stim Mult 3 that apparently was disabled by not
having the source scale propagation active.  With scale propagation, an
overloaded blast from an EMP Rifle will destroy any mechanical enemy
within a relatively large radius.  That's a bit too much.  Actually, now
that I've tried this and thought about it, it seems to me that these
area-effect weapons probably shouldn't have their damage affected by
accuracy.  Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any way to disable
skill and SharpShooter bonuses for particular weapons without also
disabling their Modification bonuses.


*** Monster Weapons

Analysis:

Occasionally dead monsters drop their claws, spikes, or lead pipes,
which are invisible but detectable by psionic Remote Pattern Detection,
even after the corpse fades.  Apparently they inherit
"Psi/Radar_type"="powerup" from the Weapons superclass.

Recommendation:

++ Monster Melee Weapons (-169)
   Added Psi:Radar Type = none

Result:

Those dots no longer show up on Remote Pattern Detection.

** Armor

*** Hazard Suit

**** Energy=Radiation and Viral=Biohazard

Analysis:

Hazard Suit says it gives 75% protection from Radiation and Biohazard
damage.  Viruses should count as Biohazard, and "Energy" attacks should
qualify as Radiation, but the Hazard Suit doesn't give any protection
from Energy or Anti-Human (viral) damage.  

Recommendation:

++ Hazard Suit Effects (-3487)
   add Act/React: Receptrons: Energy Stim: Min 0, Max none, Amplify by 0.80
   add Act/React: Receptrons: Anti-Human: Min 0, Max none, Amplify by 0.50
++ Vacc Suit (-83)
   add Links: Armor Effect: Hazard Suit Effects (-3487)

Result:

Not much.  It's still not useful as armor anyway.

**** Air Supply

Analysis: 

Also note that the "hazard suit" has self-contained breathing apparatus.  
You should not be able to drown while wearing it.

-- Hazard Suit Effects (-3487)
   add Act/React: Receptrons: Water Stim: Min 0, Max none, Amplify by 0.00
   ---- no effect - you still drown.

-- Hazard Suit Effects (-3487)
   add Act/React: Receptrons: Water Stim: Min 0, Max none, Abort
   ---- no effect - you still drown.

Water Stim must be handled differently by the engine.  I don't see any 
receptrons for it, and I can't seem to block it.  Maybe giving the armor
metaproperty a Breath Config property would override the player's need to
breathe.

Recommendation:

++ Hazard Suit Effects (-3487)
   add Dark Gamesys: Breath Config:
       Max Air: 45000, Drown Freq: 1000, Drown Damage: 0, Recover Rate: 1000.00

Result:

That's the ticket.  It is now impossible to drown while wearing a hazard 
suit.  If you take it off under water, you'll start drowning immediately,
though.  I don't think I can do anything about that.  Just put it back on
and you can breathe again.

*** WormSkin

Analysis:

WormSkin gives its 20% "Combat" damage reduction against energy and
"anti-human" attacks instead of its 30% "Biohazard" or "Radiation"
protection.  This isn't exactly wrong, but at the end of the game, 20%
protection is just too weak.  Of course, so is 30%.

Recommendation:

++ Worm Skin Effects (-3489)
   Act/React: Receptrons: Energy Stim: Amplify: Multiply by 0.80 -> 0.70
   Act/React: Receptrons: Anti-Human: Amplify: Multiply by 0.80 -> 0.70

Result:

Not much.  WormSkin is still pretty useless as armor.  The +2 PSI bonus
and the radiation protection are the only good reasons to wear it.

*** Powered Armor

Analysis:

Powered Armor gives 75% protection from Energy (not 50%) but no
protection from Radiation or Electricity.  It multiplies Energy damage
by 0.50 <I>twice</I>.  Was one of those originally intended to affect
Radiation or Electricity?  50% Radiation protection would make the
Powered Armor too useful, but 10% wouldn't.

Recommendation:

++ Reflec Armor (-82)
   increase GameSys: Armor: Radiation from 0.00 to 10.00
++ Powered Armor Effects (-3488)
   removed second Act/React: Receptrons: Energy Stim: Amplify by 0.50
   added Act/React: Receptrons: Electricity: Amplify by 0.50

Result:

Not particularly noticable.  

** Other

*** Med Bed Detox

Analysis:

The Surgical Units can repair any and all damage you've sustained
instantly, but for no apparent reason, they can't cure Annelid poison,
although a standard Detox Hypo can.  There "should" be some way to make
Surgical Units remove poison effects.  The "TrapToxinCleanse" script
should do this, but affects all players in multiplayer.  It also needs
to be triggered somehow, but adding a button script to the Med Bed
breaks the Med Bed's script.

Recommendation:

++ created new stimulus type "DetoxStim" (-4450)

++ created new Misc MetaProperty "Detox Button" (-4451)
   added Act/React: Sources: DetoxStim, Intensity 1, Contact, Frob in World
   added Player: Hazard: Toxin 0

++ Med Bed (-961)
   added MetaProperty "Detox Button" (-4451)

++ Partial Med Bed (-1675)
   added Act/React: Receptrons: DetoxStim, Min=0, No Max, Effect=Add MetaProperty
     Target=Me, Agent="Detox Button" (-4451)

++ Med Bed Key (-1676)
   added Act/React: Sources: DetoxStim, Intensity 1, Contact, Frob Inv->World

++ The Player (-384)
   added Act/React: Receptrons: DetoxStim, Min=0, No Max, Effect=Set Property
     Property="Toxin", Target=Me, Agent=Source

Result:

Surgical Units now remove toxin, but the toxin indicator doesn't disappear, it
just shows zero toxin.  Good enough for now.


*** various unfrobbable objects that highlight in the HUD

Analysis:

Several non-interactive objects highlight in the HUD as though they
were interactive, even though they are not frobbable and do not interact
in any way with anything at all.  They should not highlight.  These 
include:
- "Unidentified Hull Deposit" screens on Rickenbacker.
- Birthing orifices in the BotM.
- Rotating holograms in the QBRs.

Recommendation:

++ RickMany Computer Screen (-4280)
   delete Obj: HUD Selectable?: TRUE
++ Egg Depositor (-930)
   add Obj: HUD Selectable?: FALSE
++ Regen_Hologram (-3522)
   add Obj: HUD Selectable?: FALSE

Result:

These items no longer get brackets around them.

*** Missing object descriptions

Analysis:

Some objects (keys, logs, nanites, cyber modules) apparently do not have
descriptions.  Instead of a description when examined, they show their
object name, without replacing the %s and %d placeholders.

The description for the Nanites, Keys, and Cyber Modules buttons on the 
HUD are "FakeNanites", "fakekeys", and "FakeCookie".  I'll just use those
strings for the respective objects

Audio Logs do not have a description yet, since the string in the objlooks
file (which appears for the PDA button) applies to the PDA and its software,
not to seperate downloadable logs. I'll have to make one up.

Recommendation:

++ Nanites (-85)
   add Obj: Object look string: FakeNanites
++ EXP Cookies (-938)
   add Obj: Object look string: FakeCookie
++ ID Cards (-157)
   add Obj: Object look string: fakekeys

Result:

Querying these objects shows their descriptions now.

*** ID Card names too long

Analysis:

ID Card names were too long for the Info MFD.

Recommendation:

They have been shortened.  See "objshort.str" for details on that.

Results:

The ones I've managed to check all fit now.

*** Audio Logs don't Query well

Analysis:

Audio Logs have no descriptions or shortnames, so they default
to their longnames, without interpolation, and leave the rest 
blank.  Usually this doesn't matter because most players will 
simply click on them and download them, making the object no
longer available to query and the data available for viewing.

Adding lines to objshort.str and objlooks.str for AudioLog and 
linking the archetype to them is easy enough, and the situation
doesn't really call for making unique new description entries
for each log and editing every log object in the game just to 
be able to put their headers in the query MFD window.

Recommendation:

objshort.str: add line 19
AudioLog:"Standard Data Disc\n\n\n%s"

objlooks.str: add line
AudioLog:"An audio log:"

++ Audio Log (-76)
  add Obj Look string: AudioLog
  add Obj short name: AudioLog

Results:

The log's headers (as interpolated by %s) appear in the text
box of the query MFD, but they don't line up the same as
everything else does.  That's okay.  They also won't scroll
because they're actually part of the shortname and are just
displayed a few lines lower than the rest of the shortname.
That's okay, too.


*** plants don't transition between levels

Analysis:

Potted plants, commonly collected in big piles to be fed to
the Recycler for a sum of one nanite each, do not transition
between levels if they're not actually in your inventory.

Recommendation:

++ Plant #2 (-69)
  add Multilevel: Elevator-able? = TRUE

Results:

Potted plants now move between levels normally when left in
the elevator/bulkhead.

** Ramses Center

*** File: earth.mis

**** Zombies in Ramses Center with Rebirth models

When the Rebirth patch is installed, it becomes obvious that the four 
humans in earth.mis are using "corpse" models.  This can be fixed rather
easily by changing them from "corpse_" to "cru" models.  I picked 
engineering uniforms for no actual reason.

*** File: medsci1.mis

**** invisible (No Refs) Med Hypo (#234)

Analysis:

There's an invisible (No Refs) Med Hypo (#234) in upstairs Cryo B, next
to the debris on the lower floor leading to the upper monitoring
station.  Should be put inside something, made visible, or deleted.

Recommendation:

++ medsci1.mis: Med Patch (234) at (57.11, -158.77, -2.21)
   moved to (57.11, -158.77, -3.86) - on the floor

Result:

A med hypo.

**** The glass tube that completely blocks the Cryo Recovery door

Analysis:

from ZylonBane:

> initial escape unbreakable.

> Okay, I'd like to withdraw the request to have the glass on the
> yellow-smoke thingy made unbreakable. Instead... get rid of that

A very good point.  That obviously very broken door wouldn't have done
any good if it did open, since there's no way people could actually
have walked normally past that glass tube and its metal railings, let
alone pushed a gurney through there.  I tried removing it, but the room
looked too empty with just a broken door, an unbreakable window, and two
breakable junction boxes.  Instead, I'll make it a lot smaller and move 
it into the corner of the room.  And instead of making it unbreakable, a
little more work will make lots more "random yellow gas stuff" appear if
you break the glass tube.  If it was unbreakable, what would those
railings be protecting?  Or, I suppose I could make it unbreakable and 
remove the railings...  Let's try this first...

Result:

blocking the door.

**** The door that opens the wrong way

Analysis:

The door in the Research and Development sector that opens onto the
catwalk above the recharger with a corpse that has a shotgun translates
the wrong way, into the solid wall instead of into the niche.

Recommendation:

++ Sci Med Door (74)
   Heading: 0 -> 180

Result:

Slides into its niche like any other door.


**** some VB Secure windows are badly stretched

Analysis:

The "VB Secure" windows with the diagonal lines and the circular decal
need to be 10.01x4.01 in order to look right.  Only the ones around the
maintenance access room are actually that size.  Other sizes look okay
as long as they're close enough in aspect, but many of them are way
off.

- the first one, at hybrid chase scene, is wrong (1.0, 0.9, 1.5)
- the ones on the maintenance access room are perfect (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
- the ones at the security room next to maint access are close (1.0, 1.2, 1.5)
- the engineering security station is good - it's small and clips off the decals.
- Ops Override room is okay
- Command B Security Office is good
- Rick3 window I modified to not shoot through is way off

Recommendation:

++ Security Glass (1309) at (52.85, -39.05, 1.52)

   change height from 7.00 to 5.80
   move to (-18.25, -162.00, 2.30)

Result:

The diagonals are closer to perpendicular and the circles are
closer to circular.  The window across the hall looks too big
now that the one you watch the hybrid chase scene through is
smaller.  Resizing all the windows in those hallways to height
4.01 might not be a bad idea, but it would be a lot of work for
very little reason.  This is good enough for now.


*** File: medsci2.mis

**** hidden pistol (#1431)

Analysis:

Hidden Pistol #1431 on ledge across from walkway in Crew Sector looks
"Modified" but isn't.  Add "Gun/Base Gun Description" with stim mult 1.1
and clip size 24 to make it equal to a normally modified Pistol.
Otherwise, it effectively skips Modification Level 1 and if you modify
it to Level 2, it gets <I>only</I> the Level 2 mods.  Yes, this means
that if you can find this one after I've fixed it, you get a barely
functional Pistol with a free level of Modification, not to mention the
three Standard Bullets in its clip.  Note that this does <B>not</B> make
it the best Pistol in the game.

Recommendation:

++ medsci2.mis: Pistol (1431) at (-119.41, 47.20, 3.75)
   added Gun: Base Gun Description:
      Setting 0 Clip = 24
      Setting 0 Stim Mult = 1.10
      Setting 1 Clip = 24
      Setting 1 Stim Mult = 1.10

Result:

This pistol now functions in all respects as a normal pistol that has
been modified once.  At least until it breaks, which is usually only a
few shots.

*** backwards ART-terminal

Analysis:

"There are backwards ART-terminals all over the ship."
  - ZylonBane

One is on the left wall of the first room in the MedSci crew sector.

The one next door that flies off the wall with an explosion sometimes
lands upside-down.  This appears to be random.  I can't think of any 
easy way to fix it that would look right, so I'll leave it.

Recommendation:

++ A Pic 09 (317)
   change Heading from 0 to 180
   move from (-116.75, -162.99, 1.06) to (-116.75, -162.90, 1.06)

Results:

Fixed.


** Multi-Level issues

*** Main Elevator Alignment

Analysis:

The main elevator signs and buttons don't match up.  The buttons are
usually pretty close, but as ZylonBane pointed out, "The screens in
the elevators on MedSci and Rec jump up about a foot compared to when
on other decks. On Rec this applies to both elevators."

Recommendation:

Just for the sake of thoroughness, I'm aligning both buttons and the
sign to exactly the same offset from the center of the room on all
five levels.

*** Elevator Muzak

Analysis:

The elevator muzak from System Shock should play in the main elevator 
after you get the power turned on.  Perhaps the speakers should be 
breakable, though, since that music is so amazingly repetitive.  And
once broken, maybe they could be repaired?  Or maybe the elevator
music could be hacked somewhere to change it to something less
repetitive?  Maybe... But for now, just the muzak.

Results:

It works, mostly.  The elevator plays muzak once the power is restored.  
It is audible in the elevator and in the hallway, as long as the elevator 
doors are open.  In the next update, maybe I'll come up with a way to 
turn it off, possibly by destroying the speakers.

It doesn't work normally on Hydro, probably because that level is stripped.
The alternate solution of adding AmbientHacked attributes to the screens 
did work.  The laser rapier glow appears to not work for the same reason.
Maybe I'll just leave that one rapier non-glowing.  The changes just aren't 
there after the level loads in the game, as if some objects (like both
screens and the cyber module gift for learning Research) load their edited
form and others (the added sound traps, the edited laser rapier, and the 
cyber modules whose count I changed) loaded previous, unmodified versions
or didn't load the newly created objects at all.  These changes do appear 
when played in the editor directly, but not if the level is loaded 
normally, even in the editor.

I was considering some more complicated gimmicks here, like repairing some
elevator music control to make it play a longer loop, or hacking it to play
Elvis tunes or something.  Stripped levels make things like that way too
much work, if not entirely impossible.

*** Note_4_1 trigger

Analysis:

Note_4_1 needs to be checked off when Note_2_8 is added, but reading
a log can only do one of these things, and we don't know where the
player will be when he reads the log.

Recommendation:

Add a Simple QB Trigger to each level to detect Note_2_8 being active
and SwitchLink it to a QB Set trap to mark Note_4_1 complete.

*** Too many Disruption Grenades

Analysis:

There are more Disruption Grenades in the original game than any other 
type, if you don't count the randomly generated Fragmentation Grenades
carried by Grenade Hybrids.  They are not available until Recreation 
deck, and in the original game, they do the least damage of all.  This
makes no sense.

Since I'm rebalancing the grenades to use fixed damage without source
scale propagation, which was, in fact, the reason these did so much less
damage, I've decided to make them the most powerful against single 
targets, with a very small radius, and less numerous, depending on the 
Difficulty:

		Easy		Normal	Hard		Impossible
Rec A		3		3		0		0
Rec B		3		3		3		0
Comm B	9		6		6		3
Rick 1	15		12		6		3

Result:

These things kick ass, and you only need one point of Heavy skill to 
fire them.  They can kill a Rumbler with one hit on the back.  If you 
hit them on their big armored nose, they'll keep charging at you.  
Probably has to do with the way effect falloff by radius is calculated 
from the "center" of the model.  They're also effective against big
bots, assassins, reavers, and anything else that's giving you trouble.

45 of them (normal) is plenty.  Maybe too many.  60 (easy) is way more
than you need, but that's supposed to be easy, right?

*** Auto-Repair Units

Analysis:

With enough Auto-Repair Units in the game to fix almost everything that's
already broken, and enough replacement weapons to not bother fixing them
if they break, there's just no reason to ever use Repair skill.  There are
eight of them.  I've never even used them all in one game.  Two is enough
to fix the broken keypad on Rec and one of the broken replicators.  Four
will get you the keypad, two early broken weapons, and a replicator.  If 
you need more than that, you're probably doing something wrong.

Recommendation:

There should be only four ARUs on Normal difficulty and two on hard.  None
for Impossible.

*** French-Epstein Devices

Analysis:

Only the Fusion Cannon requires Modify 4 for its first modification 
and 6 for its second.  The EMP Rifle and Viral Proliferator require 3 
and 5, and four weapons require Modify 2 and 4.  There are 6 or 7 FEDs
in the game (one already depends on difficulty).  Modify skill 4 and 
four FEDs is enough to double-modify one of each weapon in the game.
With Modify 3, it would take eight FEDs, but most players don't use
ALL the weapons, so Modify 3 is usually all you need, unless you don't
have enough Maintenance to keep your weapons from breaking (and aren't
using the magically unbreakable weapons.)  Having six FEDs on 
Impossible means not having to spend a single point on Modify and still
double-modify three weapons, or four if you start with the pre-modified
pistol, shotgun, and/or EMP rifle.  

Recommendation:

I think we could do with a few less.  Removing the ARUs and FEDs will 
have a significant impact on Impossible mode.  Much more so than 
removing them altogether would affect Easy or Normal modes.  These 
devices have a mitigating effect on the increased cost of skills in 
higher levels.

Nothing should be so easy in "Impossible" mode.  Removing the FEDs 
completely from Impossible will leave you with weapons that do less 
damage and use more ammo, both of which narrow your margin of error 
and use up the available ammo faster.  That's in addition to the more 
expensive skills requiring more of your upgrade modules to get to the 
same skill levels.  You'll also be firing more rounds to kill the same 
number of enemies, thus wearing out the weapons faster.  

On Difficult mode, there should be enough FEDs available to at least
modify your preferred weapons once, maybe twice if you buy a little
skill or use a pre-modified weapon.  Three is enough for that.

In Multiplayer, there are more players using more weapons, but there
are also more skill points to go around, and only one player needs to 
spend the points in Modify for all players to get modified weapons.

*** Ice Picks

Analysis:

Because of these, there is no need for more Hack skill than level 4.  There 
are just enough of them to open all the high-security crates and two of 
SHODAN's shields.  They don't entirely obviate Hacking, though.  Removing 
some or all of them at higher difficulty levels would be equivalent to
removing the high-security crates from those difficulties, since it's only
at the lowest difficulty that you can afford to buy Hack 6 and only use it
three times.  And what's in those crates is certainly not worth all those 
modules.  Maybe it would make sense to have only three on Hard, so you 
have to choose whether to open the crates with them or save them for SHODAN.
And no Ice Picks on Impossible, so the high-security crates will just sit 
there and laugh at you.  I think I like that idea.  Let's try that and see
how it goes.

Oops.  I forgot about the one mandatory hack, the replicator on Command
where you buy the harmonic resonator.  Even on Impossible there should be
one Ice Pick for that.

consistent, but first I'd have to decide which combination to use,
since each deck is different, except for Engineering and Hydroponics,
which only have 3 QBRs total, including the two I can't fix.  For now
I think it will be enough to add a few "Regenerator" signs.

Results:

Except for two stripped levels (eng2, hydro2) all the QBRMs
have the "Regenerator" sign on the back.  They have different
displays on the sides, but that's okay.  I can't make them 
all the same, since the stripped levels are different, so 
there's not much point in making the side panels of the ones
I can change match.  This will have to do.

**** Coolant Tubes are too brightly lit

Analysis:

The coolant tubes are lacking atmosphere.  They should feel cramped and
dangerous and scary.  With so much light and open space, they feel just
like any other hallways, but with more random intersections and maze-like
turns and an occasional brightly glowing hazard area or keypad-locked
storage closet.

It would be possible to narrow the hallways a little, but it would be a 
huge amount of work, resizing every brush in that area.  Lowering the 
ceiling would be almost as much work, and might be more effective, except
for the hybrids clipping their pipes through the ceiling.

The easiest change that might effectively change the feeling of the area
is to reduce the lighting.  Either the "Amber Lights" on the ceilings in
the coolant tubes or the ambient light for the level, or both, could be
reduced to achieve the desired effect.  The problem with reducing the 
light levels of the Amber Lights is that it wouldn't make sense.  The 
lights wouldn't be fulfilling their obvious purpose of lighting the area.
Some of the Amber Lights could be turned off and/or broken.  Flickering
wouldn't be a good idea, since flickering lights in that area indicate
radiation leaks.

Recommendation:

-- relit level with 0.06 ambient instead of 0.08

Result:

0.06 ambient looks a little creepier in the coolant tubes, but makes the
areas that should be bright, like the elevator lobby and security room,
look too dark.  This is going to take some experimentation.  I'll revert
to the original lighting until I have time to play with it.  And I might
not ever get around to playing with this until I can view the results in
the editor, which is impossible with my current video card.  Bleh.

**** broken shotgun (#1061)

Analysis:

Broken Shotgun #1061 outside Fluidics Control looks "Modified" but
isn't.  Add "Gun/Base Gun Description" with stim mult 1.1 and reload
times 333 and 500 to make it equal to a normally modified Shotgun.  Once
this is repaired, it's still in pretty bad shape, but it will have the
free Level 1 Modification.  Note that Pistols and Shotguns are by far
the easiest weapons in the game to Modify manually, so I'm not
especially worried about unbalancing things by making these weapons that
already <I>say</I> Modification 1 actually work like weapons that have
been modified once.  Especially in light of the <I>unbreakable</I> and
<I>recoilless</I> weapons I found elsewhere.

Recommendation:

++ eng1.mis: shotgun (1061) at (1.33, -418.80, -5.75)
   added Gun: Base Gun Description
      Setting 0 Stim Mult = 1.10
      Setting 0 Reload Time = 333
      Setting 1 Stim Mult = 1.10
      Setting 1 Reload Time = 500

Result:

This shotgun now functions in all respects as a normal shotgun that has
been modified once, and then broken.

**** invisible (No Refs) Rifled Slug Box (#1586)

Analysis:

There's an invisible (No Refs) Rifled Slug Box (#1586) near the corpses
outside the Xerxes core.  It should be on a corpse or deleted.  I'm
leaning toward deleting it.  It's not like Rifled Slugs are hard to come
by, what with all the Hybrids running around that area.

Recommendation:

++ eng1.mis: Rifled Slug Box (1586)
   deleted

Result:

None - it no longer shows up with Remote Pattern Detection, but most
players wouldn't have that yet anyway.

**** invisible (No Refs) Small AP Clip (#1634)

Analysis:

There's an invisible (No Refs) Small AP Clip (#1634) near the corpse
between Grav Shafts.  It should be on the corpse or deleted.  I'm
leaning toward putting it on the corpse, but maybe only on lower
Difficulty settings.

Recommendation:

++ eng1.mis: Small AP Clip (1634)
   add Link: ~Contains: Male Corpse 1 (1667), Ordinal = 1
   add Difficulty: Permit: values: {0, 1, 2} (easy, normal)

Result:

A small clip of AP bullets on some corpse, only in Normal or Easy 
difficulty.  See above for reasons why we may need a few more bullets 
in the beginning of the game.

**** Early Broken Assault Rifle

Analysis:

Having made Standard weapons easy to use, the limiting factor in using
an Assault Rifle is getting to Hydroponics A to find the first one in
the game.  Adding a broken one in the weapons stash in the Engineering
nacelle makes it available almost a full level earlier, if you can fix
it.  You have not yet found the first Auto-Repair Unit at this point.

Recommendation:

++ eng1.mis: add Assault Rifle (1894)
   Position: Location=(88.22, -33.96, -57.01)
   Position: Alignment=(0.02, 324.71, 270.29)
   Gun: Gun State = (Ammo 0, Condition 9, Setting 0, Modification 0)
   Obj: State = Broken

Result: 

One broken, empty assault rifle.  With the lower skill requirements, 
anyone should be able to fix this with the first Auto-Repair Unit at
ACR3 on Hydro and be using it half a level earlier than in the original
game, albeit with significantly less damage output until you get that
Standard skill up.  Assault Rifles for all!  But hacker/psionic types
might actually be better off just modifying and maintaining one of 
those recoil-compensated pistols from Engineering.

**** double protocol droid box

Analysis:

As Quist noted,there are two Protocol Droid crates on the same spot on 
the upper level of cargobay 1A (left-hand side).

- eng2.mis: Closed Protocol Box (847) at (72.7454, -684.809, 8.85083)
- eng2.mis: Closed Protocol Box (849) at (72.7454, -684.809, 8.85083)

Recommendation:

++ eng2.mis: delete Closed Protocol Box (847) 

Result:

Confirmed.

**** Cargo Bay 1 door lock

Analysis:

The outer keycard slot is broken, so any behaviour is explainable as a
malfunction, and the door is supposed to open without a keycard, as 
though the lock had been unlocked.  The problem is that the inner slot
is not broken, but is red and behaves like a normal keycard slot that 
you don't have the proper card for, yet the door opens just fine from 
either side.  It would make more sense if the inner lock was visibly
unlocked and the outer one flickered.  Perhaps the outer lock should
also make some kind of error noise or give an error message, but I 
think it's pretty obvious that it's supposed to be broken.  And it's 
broken in a useful way, so you don't need Repair skill to get in.

Recommendation:

++ eng2.mis: edit Card slot (1468) - inner
   add Shape/Model Name: cardslog
   changed Tweq: ModelsState: clear On and Reverse flags
++ eng2.mis: edit Card slot (1407) - outer
   add Tweq/Models: Halt=Continue, Rate=100

Result: 

The outer (smoking, crooked) cardslot blinks red and green, and the 
inner cardslot is steady green, so it now makes sense for neither of
them to respond in any interesting way to being frobbed.  One's very 
broken, and the other is already open.  Anything more interesting 
would probably take way too much work anyway, since that level is
stripped.

**** Cargo Bay 2 door lock

Analysis:

The card slot on the inside of Cargo Bay 2 is red even when unlocked.  
The problem is that it is always unlocked and not even coded to a card.
Unfortunately, this level is stripped, so it may be impossible to get
this card slot to work normally.  Just changing the default model to
"cardslog" - the one with the green light - might be close enough.  Or
setting the CARGO2 card KeyDst and clearing the ModelState On flag.

Recommendation:

++ eng2.mis: edit Card slot (1399)
   add Engine Features: KeyDst: {FALSE, CARGO2, 0}
   add Engine Features: Locked: TRUE
   changed Tweq: ModelsState: clear On flag

Result: 

The door opens from the inside after the outer lock is opened, but the
inner lock now turns green when clicked just for appearances.

**** 10 CMs to learn Research

Analysis:

On Impossible, going from zero to one in technical abilities costs 17
CMs. So, it would really be nice if "Polito" gave you a bit more to
reflect that.  Increase the gift from 10 to 17 and reduce 7 other CMs
by 1.  (See also hydro2.mis)

Recommendation:

++ A Small BP Pile (90) - 
   reduce Engine Features/Stack Count from 3 to 2

**** Shotgun Sam walks through a door that doesn't open

Analysis:

One of the named hybrids, "Shotgun Sam", waits for you in a room that
can only be accessed by jumping through a window, but he (and other
AIs) can walk through the broken door.  Judging from the fact that he
has a name and several tripwires and paths linked to him, I think he
was supposed to do more than just wait there and walk through the 
broken door.

Recommendation:

The broken door should be passable to everyone or no one.  Either the 
door should close and jam behind Sam after he runs out, or it should 
open and close normally, or it should just be permanently broken.  I'm
going to try making it permanently broken and impassable first.  That
is probably the easiest solution.

Trapping Sam in that room turns out to be a bad idea, both because of
his tripwires and paths and because even if he can't walk through the
door, he will clip through it and poke his head out for you to shoot
at, which is just silly.

Since he actually starts in the other room, which does have a working
door, and just walks through a broken door to get to that room he waits
in, that door should also be made impassable, which might get him to do
something more sensible, like wait in the accessable room and open the
door to charge at you, but only if his patrol path is changed so that he
won't try to walk through closed doors to get there.

++ HydroDoorWide (135)
   change Physics: Misc: AI Collides With: from FALSE to TRUE
++ HydroDoorWide (183)
   change Physics: Misc: AI Collides With: from FALSE to TRUE
+- create Patrol Path (2147) at (-38.06, 124.00, -1.00)
   (clone of SamPath #2132)
   AIPatrol link to Patrol Path (2065)
+- SamPath (2132)
   move to (-47.00, 127.00, -1.00)
   delete AIPatrol link to Patrol Path (2065)
   AIPatrol link to Patrol Path (2147)

Damn these stripped levels.  Loaded and played directly in the editor,
the new path objects make Sam open the openable door, walk out, and 
start patrolling.  When loaded through the elevator, SamPath reverts 
to its original location, so he doesn't step on the tripwire to open 
the door, and it loses the link to the new Patrol Path object because 
the new object gets discarded when the level loads.  

Now he just waits in the accessible room.  He didn't bother coming out.
This may not be the behaviour we want, but it's better than walking 
through closed doors.

++ ShotgunSam (801)
   delete AIPatrol link to SamPath (2132)
   add AIPatrol link to Door Tripwire (599)
++ Door Tripwire (599)
   add AIPatrol link to Patrol Path (2065)

Result:

That worked.  Now he uses the door tripwire itself as a patrol point,
so he just steps on it, opens the door, and wanders out into the hall
to start patrolling.  Much better.


**** 10 CMs to learn Research

Analysis:

On Impossible, going from zero to one in technical abilities costs 17
CMs. So, it would really be nice if "Polito" gave you a bit more to
reflect that.  Increase the gift from 10 to 17 and reduce 7 other CMs
by 1.  (See also hydro1.mis)

Recommendation:

++ EVENT1Experience (596) - reward to buy Research skill
   increase GameSys: Exp from 10 to 17
!! A Medium BP Pile (634) - on platform over flooded area
   reduce Engine Features/Stack Count from 3 to 2

   reduce GameSys/Exp from 13 to 11
++ ACR3-Experience (645) - reward for Regulator 3
   reduce GameSys/Exp from 13 to 11

Result:

The Toxin-A email does come with 17 modules now, and the Environmental
Regulators give the right number of points, but the loose stacks of 
Cyber-Upgrade Modules did NOT change their count.  The ACR rewards were
reduced further to make up for it.  I suppose this should only apply to 
Impossible difficulty, but until I get an un-stripped copy of hydro2.mis
it's going to have to be one way or the other.


**** Toxin-A

Analysis:

There are five vials of Toxin-A and you only need four.  After using
four, the fifth can crash the game back to Windows.  The only reason to
have more than four would be in a Multiplayer game, when a player who
isn't currently in the game might have one of them.  Planning to make
one of the two in the Biological Survey Lab only exist in Multiplayer
games.

Recommendation:

++ hydro2.mis: Anti-Annelid Toxin (547) at (-58.47, 102.34, -2.52)
   added Difficulty/Permit: quest var values = 0, 5

Result:

No useless extra vial of Toxin-A in single-player mode.  Haven't checked
multi-player.

**** ACR3 doesn't show on map

Analysis:

The Hydroponics C Environmental Regulator, ACR3, doesn't have an icon
on the map, like ACR2 does.  ACR2 shows up as an "A" on the map.  I 
don't see any difference between the two, or any marker that is missing.
I don't know why one shows up and the other doesn't.  So I'm going to
experiment with some variables that I don't understand and see if 
anything interesting happens.

Recommendation:

+- ACR3 (910)
   add Object: Map Icon: "mnav"

Result:

No effect.  Maybe this is the wrong property, or maybe it just doesn't
work in stripped levels.

**** inaccessible Laser Rapier

Analysis:

There's an inaccessible Laser Rapier <U>under</U> the floor next to the
Environmental Regulator on Hydroponics D.  I'm probably just going to
delete it, although I'm still considering moving it <U>onto</U> the
floor.  There's really no need for any more Laser Rapiers in Single
Player mode.  I don't know about Multiplayer, though.  By the end of
Hydroponics, it's certainly possible that there might be three players
in a Multi game who want a Laser Rapier, but does that necessarily mean
they should all have one?

Recommendation:

++ hydro3.mis: Electro Shock (102) at (-135.00, -83.50, -11.64)
   moved to (-135.00, -83.50, -11.42)
   added Difficulty: Permit: quest var values = 0, 5

Result:

Doesn't show up on Hard difficulty, which is no change.  Haven't checked
multiplayer yet.

**** Running right or left gets you stuck outside the platform

Analysis:

The invisible walls that pop up immediately after you enter the area
you're supposed to be in don't pop up fast enough to keep you there if
you just run to either side without stopping to search the corpse and
desk.  Since they're invisible, and they're supposed to prevent you from
sidestepping off the platform before the rest of the room drops away, 
there's no reason for them not to already be in that position BEFORE you 
step onto the platform.

Recommendation:

++ create New Tripwire (708) clone of (204)
   move to (19, 16, -19.72)
   size to (1, 12, 12)
   add link --switchlink-> force door fx (133)
   add link --switchlink-> force door fx (134)

Result:

The side forcefields pop up before you get to the platform area.  Of
course, if you really want to get around the walls, you can still just
drop something on the floor at the entrance to the room, and the wall
can't pop up.  That's a bit harder to do by accident, though.

**** Objects (the pistol) cannot be dropped on the desk

Analysis:

The desk apparently extends its bounding box all the way to the ceiling
for no apparent reason.  Maybe there is a good reason for this that just
isn't apparent.

Recommendation:

I think I'm going to leave this alone for now.  It's not really a problem.

Result:

None.

**** The wall the the desk is further from the edge than the others

Analysis:

The force field that keeps you from walking past the desk and off the
platform starts almost at the front of the desk, instead of near the edge
of the platform.  Resizing a few force fields should fix this.

Recommendation:

++ force door fx (131)
   move from (44.26, 15.85, -31.79) to (45.25, 15.85, -31.79)

Result:

Not much different, but it wasn't a big deal in the first place.

**** Explanation for SHODAN's Slideshow

Analysis:

SHODAN doesn't bother to explain how She's presenting Her slideshow,
but if the walls were physically moving the way they appear to, it would
demonstrate much more power over the physical environment of the ship
than SHODAN ever displays at any other point in the game.  The only reason 
She even needs "Avatars" is that She has so little direct influence over 
physical reality until She gets control of the FTL Reality-Warp engines.

The "slideshow" must be some kind of cybernetic hallucination, but this
is never clarified in the game.  She does mention, at the end of that
cutscene, that She's the one who gave you your cybernetic implants, "The
only beauty in that /meat/ you call a 'body'."  She may have been able
to tamper with the implants and install a back-door to remotely access
them, but I doubt she'd actually have needed to do much work to arrange
that.  Remote access to implanted cybernetic interfaces sounds like just
the kind of thing Tri-Optimum would have built into their R-Grade rigs
in the first place.  All SHODAN would have had to do was configure it to
give Herself access.  A few lines of Use Messages on some TrapMessage and
TrapDelay objects could show Her using that back-door just before the
room starts coming apart at the seams.

This also explains why She knows where you are and what you're doing, 
even when you've destroyed all the cameras.  Your own eyes are Her
cameras.

Recommendation:

*** File: ops2.mis

**** The Ops QBR Deathtrap

Analysis:

Enemies are much too fond of hanging out in the elevator room in Ops B, 
right next to the QBR.  This is partially because there are no less than 
five Patrol Paths circling clockwise around that room.
#852 (T intersection in hallway) ->
#480 (Just inside the doorway) -> 
#883 (In front of Bulkhead 41) -> 
#340 (In front of Elevator) -> 
#343 (In front of Bulkhead 44) -> 
#356 (Between Bulkhead 44 and door) ->
#395 (First turn in hallway)

There is also a spawn point in that room, where monsters can spawn while
you're on the other side of the level and wait there for you to get close
enough to wake them up, which you can do by dying and respawning just a 
few feet away from them.

Ecology (122) EcoType 1 --SwitchLink-> RandMonsterGen (123) 
is SpawnPoint linked to:
Marker #126 (right in front of the Xerxes screen)
Marker #142 (alcove with bench at door between admin and lounge)
Marker #143 (at security crate next to chem storeroom)
Spawn Marker #1055 (middle of admin area)
Spawn Marker #1056 (under lounge)
Spawn Marker #1057 (grav shafts at east crew quarters)
Spawn Marker #1058 (around the corner from west quarters grav shafts)

I could short-circuit some of those nodes by pointing their AIPatrol 
links a few nodes ahead in the chain.  Short-circuiting straight from 
852 to 395 would keep patrolling enemies from going into that room at all,
but wouldn't stop them from spawning there or choosing to randomly 
start their patrol there, since they all have random patrolling set.
480 -> 356 : walk in, take a few steps toward QBR, turn around (bad idea)
883 -> 356 : check the bulkheads, but not the QBR or Elevator (maybe)
883 -> 395 : walk across one side of the room and back (maybe)
480 -> 395 : walk into the room and turn right around and leave (try this)

Recommendation:
 
+- Patrol Path (480) at (-110.84, 16.98, -19.00)
   delete AIPatrol Link and replace with AIPatrol -> A Patrol Path (395)
+- delete Patrol Path (883) at (-65.74, 14.90, -19.00)
+- delete Patrol Path (340) at (-65.90, -12.01, -19.00)
+- delete Patrol Path (343) at (-104.44, -9.98, -19.00)
+- delete Patrol Path (356) at (-105.11, 2.61, -19.00)
+- Marker (126) at (-66.76, 1.00, -18.00) 
   move to (-100.36, 8.93, -18.00)

Results:

It's hard to test the AI's behaviour, but they are mostly staying out of 
the Xerxes core area now, so it should be pretty hard to get trapped in
the QBRM.  It's a mostly safe area now, which doesn't seem quite right.
Perhaps there's a better solution, possibly involving a dimly lit, or unlit
QBRM and/or a translucent door you can see through but they can't.

**** Backwards ART-terminals

Analysis:

"There are backwards ART-terminals all over the ship." - ZylonBane

There are three in the West crew quarters area, in the SW, NE, and W rooms.  
One more is in the East crew quarters area, in the N room.

Recommendation:

++ A Pic 03 (236)
   change Heading from 270 to 90
   move from (-146.17, 131.58, -33.46) to (-146.16, 131.58, -33.46)

**** Armory Fusion Cannon

Analysis:

Need to add a broken Fusion Cannon and some Prisms in the Armory, to
make it available earlier.  See also Recreation.

Recommendation:

++ ops4.mis:
   Created Fusion Cannon (1261) at (-153.30, -158.55, -23.95)
      H = 84.93, P = 356.98, B = 257.59
      Gun: Gun State: Ammo = 42
      Gun: Gun State: Condition = 42.00
      Obj: State = Broken
++ ops4.mis:
   Created Large Prism (1262) at (-149.02, -178.07, -23.88)
      Renderer: Has Refs = FALSE
      Links: ~Contains: A Small Trioptimum Crate (351)

Result:

Apparently, this Fusion Cannon was jammed by someone in a hurry to
reload it.  It has 42 crystals in a clip that only holds 40.  If you
went to Recreation first, you already have a working Fusion Cannon, so
this just gives you another clip of ammo.  If you haven't been to
Recreation yet, and you have a spare Auto-Repair Unit, you can start
Recreation with this Fusion Cannon.

**** MedSci Armory Log

Analysis:

The the log that tells you what the MedSci Armory door code is doesn't mark the 
information in your Notes.  

Audio Log #525 plays Deck 4 Log 11 and marks Quest Bit "Note_4_1" to Value 2.
It should also set Quest Bit "Note_2_8" to Value 1.

Note_4_1:"Find the passcode for the MedSci2 sub armory."
Note_2_8:"The code to the Armory is 98383."

Until I can figure out a way to set two quest bits with one log, I'll just set 
the more relevant one.

Recommendation:

++ ops4.mis:
  Changed Audio Log (525) at (-182.65, -294.01, -38.92)
    Script/QB Name: "Note_2_8"
    Script/QB Val: 1

Result:

This part works fine.  When you read that email, you get the note that 
contains the keycode, and that's the more important note.

Maybe I can use a QBtrap, or series of QBtraps, to detect Note_2_8=1 and
set Note_4_1=2.

Or maybe picking it up could set Note_4_1=2 and reading it could set 
Note_2_8=1 , like Meyers' security office code log on Command B.

*** Unbreakable EMP Rifles

Analysis:

There are three EMP Rifles on Recreation Deck, one on a corpse near the
QBR in Recreation A, one in the Engineering Access room leaning against
the Recharger in Recreation B, and one on the corpse in the Theatre in
Recreation C.  They're all <I>unbreakable</I>.  Remind me, what was it
we needed Repair skill for?  I'm thinking of making these three into
perfectly normal, breakable, EMP Rifles.

Recommendation:

++ rec1.mis: EMP Rifle (389) at (23.68, -275.31, -12.55)
   increased Gun: Reliability: Break Threshhold from 0.00 to 2.00
++ rec2.mis: EMP Rifle (1730) at (14.68, -119.46, -10.10)
   increased Gun: Reliability: Break Threshhold from 0.00 to 2.00
++ rec3.mis: EMP Rifle (209) at (-118.82, -388.32, -31.74)
   increased Gun: Reliability: Break Threshhold from 0.00 to 2.00

Result:

These all break normally now.

**** Open to space

Analysis:

ZylonBane noted that the QBR room on the main rec deck has some 
windows in the ceiling with no glass or force fields in them.

Recommendation:

++ rec1.mis: resize triangular air brush #544
   from (4.00, 14.00, 11.00) to (4.00, 15.00, 11.25)

Result:

There are indeed windows up there now.  It's safe to enter that room
without getting sucked out into space.

**** invisible (No Refs) box of 29 Nanites (#143)

Analysis:

There's an invisible (No Refs) box of 29 Nanites (#143) on floor of
Conference Room in Recreation B.  May as well just delete it.

Recommendation:

++ rec2.mis:
   deleted 20 Nanites (143) at (-176.95, -115.41, -11.95)

Result:

It doesn't show up on Remote Pattern Detection any more.

**** mislabelled bulkhead

Analysis:

Recreation B side of Bulkhead 52 is labelled 25.  Should be easy enough
to just switch the numbers around.  I think they're seperate objects
that can be moved independently, but I haven't actually tried yet.

Recommendation:

++ rec2.mis:
   Black 5 (679) at (27.77, -194.80, -10.00)
      moved to (27.77, -197.97, -10.00)
   Black 2 (680) at (27.79, -197.97, -10.01)
      moved to (27.79, -194.80, -10.01)

Result:

Fixed.

**** fixed broken fusion cannon

Analysis:

This is normally the first Fusion Cannon you find, so it is broken to give
Repair experts that "early weapon" bonus.  I'm making the Fusion Cannons
available slightly earlier by putting a broken one in the Ops armory and
fixing this one.

Recommendation:

++ rec1.mis: Fusion Cannon (411) at (37.61, -543.75, 2.03)
   deleted Gun State: Broken

Result:

It is now a fully functional Fusion Cannon.

** Command

*** File: command1.mis

**** Hanging Lights that hang way too low

Analysis:

Anyone ever noticed that the ceiling lamps in the shuttle bays hang
down so low that any shuttle trying to take off would be hard-pressed
not to bump into them? Why they put those tiny shuttle holes so far up
on the wall I'll never know. Would have made a lot more sense flush
with the ground, like in SS1's shuttle bays.
  - ZylonBane

Recommendation:

++ command1.mis: 12' Hanging Light #507
   move from (824.86, 239.81, 7.00) to (824.86, 239.81, 10.00)
++ command1.mis: 12' Hanging Light #964
   move from (736.86, 239.81, 7.00) to (736.86, 239.81, 10.00)

Result:

Still low, but not actually blocking the exit.  Might be better to just
lower the exit, but those are made up of a LOT of brushes and will be
rather complicated to move.


**** Shuttle Command keyslots

Analysis:

Shuttle Command 2 keyslots are already green, but don't open with the
tripwire.  Shuttle Command 1 keyslot is red, opens with key, and doesn't 
turn green.

Recommendation:

++ command1.mis: A Card slot (81)
   remove Tweq: ModelsState: {On, Reverse; [None]; 0; 0}

++ command1.mis: A Card slot (80)
   remove Tweq: ModelsState: {On; [None]; 0; 0}

Result:

Both card slots start red and locked, and both unlock with the Shuttle
card and turn green, just like any other cardslot.  The ones on the ladder
side of each control room are already green and unlocked, so one might
assume that's how the Midwife got in there and how the Assassin got in
to activate the shield.  Probably best to leave those unlocked.


**** Elevator Alignment

Analysis:

The elevator signs and buttons don't match up.  The buttons are
usually pretty close, but as ZylonBane pointed out, "The screens in
the elevators on MedSci and Rec jump up about a foot compared to when
on other decks. On Rec this applies to both elevators."

Recommendation:

Just for the sake of thoroughness, I'm aligning both buttons and the
sign to exactly the same offset from the center of the room on all
five levels.

+- command1.mis: Level Change Button (422)
   move from (949.317, 106.332, -43.5) to (949.2, 106.33, -43.5)
+- command1.mis: Rec_Screen (138)
   move from (945.152, 96.8276, -41) to (945.15, 96.82, -41)
+- command1.mis: Big_Orange_Button (215)
   move from (941.144, 106.179, -43.25) to (941.15, 106.17, -43.25)

Result:

Not tested yet.

*** File: command2.mis

**** The Rumbler that chases Tommy and Becca

Analysis:

The rumbler that chases Tommy and Becca should stick around, or at least
be replaced by another identical Rumbler.  It's object #2315, "Humbler",
and it has several special properties to make it behave properly, so it's 
easier to replace it with a normal Rumbler than make it stick around and
revert it to its normal behavior.

Recommendation:

++ command2.mis
  Create Teleport Trap (1552) at (-14.48, -14.67, -40.00)
  Create Rumbler (1554) at (1.00, 0.50, -38.60)
  Switchlink Delay Trap (160) to Teleport Trap (1552)
  SwitchLink Teleport Trap (1552) to Rumbler (1554)

Result:

After Tommy and Becca escape up the small lift, a Rumbler remains
behind, along with the usual random patrol.

**** broken "Modified" EMP Rifle (#1329)

Analysis:

The hidden, broken EMP Rifle (#1329) on the floor behind the control
pedestal at the top of the Bridge Elevator looks "Modified" but isn't.
Add "Gun/Base Gun Description" with stim mult 1.1 and clip size 150 to
make it equal to a normally modified EMP Rifle.  Although EMP Rifles are
particularly tough to upgrade, I don't think there will be any
imbalances introduced by making this one actually live up to its
"Modified 1" label, since it's actually breakable and found rather late
in the game.

Recommendation:

++ command2.mis: EMP Rifle (1329) at (-10.55, 0.98, 22.40)
   added Gun: Base Gun Description:
      Setting 0 Stim Mult = 1.10
      Setting 0 Clip = 1.50
      Setting 1 Stim Mult = 2.20
      Setting 1 Clip = 1.50

Result:

If you've been putting your points into Repair instead of Modify, or if
you have more Auto-Repair Units than French-Epstein Devices (more
likely), this late find has a free level of modification.  That becomes
somewhat significant in combination with the other adjustments I'm
thinking about for EMP Rifles.  Also note that the Setting 1 Stim Mult
is 1.1 times the Setting 1 Stim Mult of the base EMP Rifle, which was
3.0 in the original game, but has been lowered to 2.0 here in order to
make the grenades that use the same explosion more powerful.

**** the unmarked chemical storeroom

Analysis:

The chemical storeroom on Command isn't marked on the map because it has
no Chem_Store_Marker.

Recommendation:

++ command2.mis:
   create Chem_Store_Marker(1551) at (72.07, -74.35, -10.53)

Result:

Confirmed.  This now appears on the map.


** Rickenbacker

*** File: rick1.mis

**** spackwalk window in pod 1 medical bay

Analysis:

There's a hole in the UBWindow 6x1x12 "Unbreakable Window" (#854) in 
the Pod 1 Medical Bay.  You can jump out the far corner of the window 
and spacewalk without a suit.

Recommendation:

++ rick1.mis: UBWindow 6x1x12 (#854)
   Physics: Model: Dimensions: Size (1,12,6) -> (1,19,6)

Result:

The window is closed now.  Yes, spacewalk was cool, but it was just _so_
wrong.  There's no music out there.  Every time I jumped out the window
to check this, I realized while trying to jump back in that I was
unintentionally holding my breath.

**** invisible (No Refs) Disruption Grenade Clips (#1582 and #1606)

Analysis:

Two invisible (No Refs) Disruption Grenade Clips (#1582 and #1606) next
to corpse #1565 near Diego's first email trigger.  Should probably be
deleted, especially if Disruption Grenades get their damage bonuses.

Recommendation:

++ rick1.mis:
   deleted Toxin Grenade (1582) at (-90.31, -60.65, 43.23)
   deleted Toxin Grenade (1606) at (-90.63, -58.70, 43.23)

Result:

They no longer show up with Remote Pattern Detection.

**** Nacelle B cardslot stays red when unlocked

Analysis:

The cardslot for Nacelle B is red and locked when you get there, and
it unlocks properly when clicked with the correct keycard, but remains
red.

Probably because of Tweq: ModelsState: {On, Reverse; [None]; 0; 0}

Recommendation:

++ Card slot (1040)
   remove Tweq: ModelsState: {On, Reverse; [None]; 0; 0}

Result:

It turns green when you unlock it.

**** loot under the floor (ceiling)

Analysis:

One Med Hypo (#153) and one Research Soft V3 (#154) are <I>under</I> the
floor (ceiling) in the first medical bay in Rickenbacker Pod 2.  Neither
one is an especially significant find at that point, so they may as well
be <I>on</I> the floor.

Recommendation:

++ rick2.mis: Med Patch (153) at (-508.43, 31.44, 286.14)
   moved to (-508.43, 31.44, 287.14)
++ rick2.mis: Research Soft V3 (154) at (-505.73, 31.06, 286.04)
   moved to (-505.73, 31.06, 287.04)

Result:

Just the kind of free loot you'd expect to find lying around in an
upside-down sick bay.

**** unbreakable window that can be fired through without breaking

Analysis:

The bottom of the first unbreakable window (#513) on the Bridge of
the Rickenbacker can be fired through without breaking the window.
You can actually kill the egg and spider on the other side by just
firing through it.  Unfortunately, the hole in the wall is 8x6 and 
the glass must be approximately 10x4 in order to look right.

Recommendation:

++ solid brush #215
   move from (-675.00, 49.00, 279.00) to (-676.00, 50.00, 279.00)

   move from (-675.00, 48.86, 283.00) to (-675.97, 49.84, 283.00)

Result:

This window is now solid, and resized so that the "VB Secure" decal is
circular and the diagonal lines are perpendicular.  Only problem now 
is that it looks like it should be taller, but that's better than 
looking squashed or looking taller than it actually is.

**** cardslots again (why didn't I notice all these before?)

Analysis:

The cardslots for Diego's Quarters and the security office are both
already green but locked when you get there, then they're green after
you unlock them, and they function properly.  Why didn't I notice all
these cardslot problems a long time ago?  Did something else I changed
create these problems?  It seems easy enough to fix, but now I want to 
go back to some of the original files and find out whether these 
cardslots were always like this.  Whether I created this problem or not,
it should be fixed anyway.

Recommendation:

+- Card slot (523)
   remove Tweq: ModelsState: {On; [None]; 0; 0}
+- Card slot (152)
   remove Tweq: ModelsState: {On; [None]; 0; 0}

Result:

** Body of the Many

*** File: many.mis

**** Wrench #156

Analysis:

Wrench #156 is <I>under</I> the floor under the membrane at the entrance
to the egg laying chamber.  Moving it from (-237.62,451.98,39.48) to
(-273.62,451.98,40.11) makes it visible and reachable, if you really
want a Wrench for the Endgame and haven't brought one with you.  I kinda
like having it there.  It's weird.

Recommendation:

++ Wrench (156) at (-237.62, 451.98, 39.48)
   moved to (-237.62, 451.98, 40.11)

Result:

Just a wrench.

**** Nerve Ladders

Analysis:

The tooth-jumping puzzle sucks.  The best fix for it I've come up with so
far is to make the nerve ladders longer, so it's harder to miss them.

Recommendation:

++ create Nerve Ladder (1352) at (-172.546, 238.83, 65.2873)
   Heading: 30.99, Pitch: 2.00, Bank: 357.97

   Heading: 61.22, Pitch: 0.00, Bank: 0.00
++ create Nerve Ladder () at (-186.29, 227.55, 70.73)
   Heading: 61.22, Pitch: 0.00, Bank: 0.00

Result:

This really doesn't make much difference.  Maybe adding enough of 
them to allow climbing <i>instead of</i> jumping would be good.

And one of them is misaligned and doesn't connect properly to the next.

Still, the maintenance skill might come in handy some day.

-Line 23-

Original:
Get back to Wake Island Station \npronto - your year on Polidies Station is finished.  Taking on the Magnate's forces was a cakewalk - you hardly spent any ammo at all.  The second fight, when his lieutenant made a play for the station, wasn't much harder.  The only thing you thought was even mildly interesting was taking apart the black market weapons afterwards to see what sort of fancy mods they'd made.

Changed: "cakewalk" -> "cake-walk"
Reason: It's hard to be sure with colloquialisms and slang, but I don't think that's a compound word, either.

Get back to Wake Island Station \npronto - your tour of duty on the UNN Antigua is finished.  You kept the Antigua running for six months, when every system in the book crashed daily.

It took you the rest of the trip to get the smell of explosives out of the air scrubbers, but you learned how to repair the damn things.

Changed: "damn" -> "damned"

Analysis:  This crystal, principally of Silicon but doped with Germanium and other unknown trace elements, appears to have a resonant frequency very close to that of neural propagation.  The crystal probably serves as a repeater for the psionic abilities of the Annelid creatures.  The crystal structure is composed of thousands of close-together crystal needles, attached together in a close-branching, nearly fractal, tree.

This can be used to get out of a tight spot, but will quickly drain the unit's energy supply and requires several seconds to cool down the its plasma chamber and charge up its capacitors before it can fire again."

Shotguns in the military had generally gone out of favor until TriOp consumer division introduced a handheld version of this 10 gauge monster.  While it works like a traditional (albeit incredibly deadly) shotgun, this magazine loaded behemoth also supports a triple load shot, which has been known to split its victims in two.  A few months after its introduction, its popularity with hunters and other weapons enthusiasts prompted a large scale purchase of the guns by the UNN military."

Original:
Laser_Pistol:"An argon-suspension laser pistol. (%s)"

Changed: "argon-suspension laser pistol" -> "Apollo H4 Laser Pistol"
Reason: Laser Pistol's ObjectName is "An argon-suspension laser pistol".  The description doesn't say anything about Argon, but does mention the model name "Apollo H4".  How much sense does it make for your HUD to describe how the Laser Pistol works the first time you see one, and in fact every time you see one, but not identify the model without a close inspection?  This "argon-suspension laser pistol" text always kinda bugged me.

Changed: "Laser" -> "Plasma"
Reason: Changing the "laser" weapons to "plasma" is more plausible and playable than making the laser weapons instant and invisible.

Modified:
Laser_Pistol:"An Apollo H4 Plasma Pistol. (%s)"

Analysis: DNA structure indicates that this organism is a hybrid of a human host and a parasitic organism.  Although the parasite (resembling a yard-long worm) has deteriorated to a stage beyond useful analysis, the effects of the process are evident.  Severe deterioration of higher level mental processes is caused by tumerous growths along the spinal column and brain stem.  The non-human tissues seem to be formed of a composite of small wormlike creatures that have adapted into the host body and taken over a majority of motor control and decision making functions.  There also appears to be direct stimulation of the autonomic nervous and glandular systems.  Hence, the organism produces exceptional amounts of both adrenaline and endorphins, making it remarkably strong and aggressive.  What remains can not really be called human at all.  The damage done to the host by the process is irrevocable, and the organism now functions with no sense of morality or hesitation.

Analysis:  This weapon appears to have been cobbled together from both human and alien technologies.  Judging by the stock and trigger, it was built by humans.  The central hexagonal core is an energy-rich media, ringed with receptacles containing nanite-virus hybrids.  Release of the virus hybrids into the core will cause cycles of replication at nanite, rather than biological, speeds, building up until the payload is released.  Additional energetic charges will disperse the viral payload in an explosive radius.

Analysis:  Genetically female, the annelid grub is the most basic annelid form.  The creature is principally nervous system and musculature - the highly advanced (for a worm) nervous system appears to be tied into a rudimentary psionic sense organ.  While wormlike in appearance, the grub has no actual digestive tract, but is furnished with energy reserves at birth.  When these are depleted, the creature shuts down into a dormant state, possibly until a further psionic trigger acts on it.  The eggs that these emerge from often contain organs that might be extracted for useful purposes, unless the egg was destroyed in combat.
