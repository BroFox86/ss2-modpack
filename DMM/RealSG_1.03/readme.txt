this minimod will make all shotgun hybrids wield an actual shotgun, which will be removed off the hybrid's hand once it's been looted from its corpse (solves that weirdness of the shotgun staying on the AI model even though you've taken it). using an actual shotgun object also makes things look nicer (and display the proper shotgun model should a weapon mod be installed as well).

installation:
-load the mod with higher priority than SCP (if used)

there are things you should know about;
-the single slug will be in the hybrid's inventory when running SCP and the supported FMs, and loaded in the hybrid shotgun when running vanilla.
-if running vanilla, the shrunken shotgun may look oddly small when compared to other weapons. load the S2 Object Shrink mod to remedy this: https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=8282.0 (RealSG needs to have higher priority)
